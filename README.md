# Comparing Baltimore vs Washington D.C. Household Income and College Graduation Rate

## Background
Baltimore and Washington D.C. are both considered two of the biggest cities in the east coast of the United States. Two cities share many similarities as they both have a population around 600,000 people and are only 30 miles apart from each other. However, Washington D.C. is generally more known to people as it is the capital of the country. Considering this fact, I wanted to compare the average household income of two cities and how the results affect the college graduation rates.
